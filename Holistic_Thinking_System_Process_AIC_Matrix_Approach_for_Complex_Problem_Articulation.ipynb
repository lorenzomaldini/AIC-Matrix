For instance, a Police Officer is not a standalone component since they are a characterizing subcomponent for the \"Police\" force component. When the problem says that the Police have been summoned, it is intuitive to think of Police Officers and cars as subcomponents of the Police component. Sometimes you will need to group related components under a more holistic component. For example, in the problem, we had Train Driver, Track Zone, Train, Control Room. We grouped those components under a more holistic one: \"Train network\". Therefore, the standalone entities involved are Trespassers, Train network, passengers, Police, and Adversarial Attack."

And then run a plausibility test by evaluating whether it is \"plausible\" or \"remotely plausible,\" then justify why you think the prediction is either valuable or remotely plausible. Remotely plausible does not mean \"impossible,\" it means it is possible but at this stage, we will accept not to consider it until it plays out in reality. However, we are aware of it. For example, in the context of Adversarial Attack vs Police, we choose an Appreciation context: the architect predicts that the Drone's behaviour in the context of the Police is to be appreciative one. The capabilities exhibited by the Drone that lead to Control Police behaviour shall be neutralized. The behaviour's Deficiency is expected to be downgraded to level c, which means we predict that it is possible to discipline Attack behaviour by reinforce Police behaviours to neutralize it. "
